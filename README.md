# Introducing
This is an open source blockchain network project. It exists for people to build and use their own blockchain networks. Or to join the network created by others.

Consensus type: Proof of Work
# To create a new blockchain network;

Open the GUI
* Create a wallet
* Start your local node server
* Start the other party's node server
* Connect to the other party's node server
* Let the creative node put itself into test mode
* Create the blockchain
That's how you created your own chain network and you were rewarded with some local coins for creating and mining the first block.

# To join the existing blockchain network;

Open the CLI
* Create a wallet
* Start your local node server
* Connect to the node you want to connect to.
* Enter the getfullchain command, so you will install the existing chain on your own node.
* Get a list of other nodes with getfullnodelist command, then click on node connection from mix_blockchain_network database to connect to registered nodes.
Now you are connected, then mine or ask other people on the network to have some coins.



# Result:
Now you can earn more mines by mining one in every 3 transactions, and you can use your mines for the data part of transaction transactions. For example, send a message with the send message button. Your message will be kept on the entire network. Or you can use this system to develop a standard cryptocurrency.
